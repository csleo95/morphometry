# morphometry

This is the manual for running the data processing pipeline of the ENIGMA-OCD Imaging Transcriptomics project. This pipeline performs an automated sequence of steps that include preprocessing NIfTI files with freesurfer’s recon-all (if required); computing morphometric features for subparcellations of the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas; using freesurfer’s run-samseg to compute morphometric statistics for subcortical structures. It should be noted that the pipeline builds upon scripts developed by Rafael Romero-Garcia et al [1]. Containerized versions of the pipeline have been developed both in the Docker and Singularity platforms for reproducibility of results and flexibility of use. 			Overall, the running of the pipeline comprises the following steps:
•	Download a handler script.
•	Execute the handler script from terminal, which will interactively prompt the user for the following information to automatically run the pipeline:
o	Whether Docker or Singularity will be used to run the pipeline (if just one of them is installed in the server, the handler script will automatically use it to run the pipeline);
o	The full path to a directory containing NIfTI files;
o	The full path to a directory containing freesurfer’s recon-all output for some / all the NIfTI files in the above directory (optional);
o	The number of threads to be used in the pipeline.
•	Check the output files generated from the pipeline.
The instructions on this manual are divided into two main sections. Section 2 has step-by-step instructions on the abovementioned steps to run the pipeline. In addition, this section has instructions on how to share the morphometric statistics generated by it. Section 3 has instructions on how to deal with potential issues that might arise when running the pipeline. 
We deeply appreciate your contribution to this project and hope you have a great experience running its data processing pipeline! If you have any questions, please contact leonardo.saraiva@usp.br.
